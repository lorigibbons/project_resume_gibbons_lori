Custom JQuery:

section.  Upon click of each h2, the items in each section collapse and if a
click happens again, it expands.

Validator also gives me warnings for using h1 elements with a class of hide.  I used then hid the h1's for outlining purposes.  I believe the outline for this project is perfect.
